# Planarity-Testing

## Implementing the planarity algorithm developed on the subject "Graph Theory". 
If the graph is not planned, the algorithm should detect it, and if it is planned, the algorithm should detect the region in the planar drawing of the graph. 
(eg. in case the graph is only one cycle, the algorithm should return two of the same regions)
